What have I learnt about Tailwind CSS:
Tailwind CSS makes it quicker to write and maintain the code of your application. By using this utility-first framework,
you don't have to write custom CSS to style your application. Instead, you can use utility classes to control the padding, margin, color, font, shadow, and more of your application

About the Project:
  I have cloned VS CODE using tailwind CSS and added some own features to it.
